<hr>
                1. Introduction <br> 
                Please carefully read the following music distribution agreement 
("Distribution Agreement"), which creates a legally binding, enforceable 
contract between you and Best So Far Digital Technologies subsidiary of 
BSF Concepts (PTY) LTD regarding your use of our digital distribution 
services and the distribution-related elements of the  Best So Far  Service. 
Throughout this Distribution Agreement, "us" "our" "we" "BSF" "Best 
So Far" and "Company" refers to Best So Far Digital Technologies; and 
"you" or "Content Distributor" refers to you, the content distributor 
("Best So Far Account"). This Distribution Agreement supersedes and 
replaces any prior agreements you and BSF may have executed with 
respect to the Catalog (defined below). The terms of this Distribution 
Agreement supplement and do not limit our Terms of Use, Copyright 
Policy, and Privacy Policy, to which you have already accepted by using 
the Service, and which this Distribution Agreement incorporates by 
reference. In the event of a conflict between these terms and any other 
agreements between you and Best So Far, including without limitation 
the Terms of Use, Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy, the terms of this 
Distribution Agreement shall govern unless provided otherwise in a 
separate signed written agreement between you and Best So Far.<br/>
BY CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE TO THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, 
YOU UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOME 
A PARTY TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER YOU ARE ACTING IN YOUR 
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE 
FOR AN ARTIST, A GROUP OR A CORPORATION, IN WHICH CASE 
"YOU" SHALL REFER TO THE ARTIST, GROUP OR CORPORATION ON 
WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACTING AND AUTHORIZED TO ACT. IF 
YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, 
CLICK THE "CANCEL" BUTTON. THE "EFFECTIVE DATE" OF THIS 
DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT IS THE DATE ON WHICH YOU CLICK THE 
"AGREE" BUTTON BELOW.
          <br> <br><br>
          
        
                2. Scope of Agreement <br> 
                Best So Far  provides digital distribution services, as well as digital asset 
management services, including metadata management, catalog 
encoding, royalty collection and reporting services to artists, artist 
managers and other owners and distributors of content. You, the 
Content Distributor, are in the business of recording, producing 
and/or marketing sound recordings, musical compositions, and/or 
other intellectual property owned, administered or distributed by you.
This Distribution Agreement covers digital distribution and other rights 
in and to the copyrights associated with the content you submit to us, 
including any and all current and future sound recordings and any 
underlying musical and literary compositions embodied in such content 
(the "Music"). Additionally, this Distribution Agreement covers all other 
digital assets and the rights thereto, including without limitation, album 
covers and other artwork, image files, marketing materials, trade 
names, trademarks, and logos, etc., that you submit to us ("Digital 
Assets"). Together, the Music and the Digital Assets shall be referred to 
collectively as the Catalog ("Catalog"). You may from time to time elect 
to add to the Catalog by supplying new content or amending existing 
content, the submission or amendment of which shall be subject to the 
terms of this Distribution Agreement.<br/><br/><br/>
            
                        3. Terms <br> 
                For any individual track or album within the Catalog, this Distribution 
Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue 
until either you, by logging into the Service and either changing your 
settings or contacting us directly, or we, by sending you an email, 
submit a termination request.
Within ten (10) days following the submitting of a termination request 
pursuant to Section 3.1 above with respect to an individual track or 
album or your entire Catalog ("Withdrawn Content"), Best So Far shall 
notify all relevant Third Party Music Services about the termination and 
request the removal of the Withdrawn Content from such Third Party 
Music Services. If you submit a termination request pursuant to Section 
10 of the Terms Of Use in relation to your  Best So Far  Account, Best So 
Far will treat this as a termination request with respect of your entire 
Catalog. You understand and agree that BSF's obligations upon the 
termination of this Distribution Agreement shall be limited to the 
aforesaid, and  under no circumstances shall Best So Far  be liable for any 
Third Party Music Service's failure to promptly remove the Withdrawn 
Content following its receipt of BSF's request thereof.<br/><br/><br/>

                4. Rights You Grant Us <br> 
                Subject to this Distribution Agreement you hereby authorize Best So Far
to store, copy and distribute your Catalog to any consumer and B2B 
digital music stores, distributors and other third-party services available 
to you through the Service ("Third Party Music Services").
To the extent necessary for Best So Far to facilitate the distribution to 
Third Party Music Services authorized by you, you hereby grant to Best 
So Far the right and authorization to distribute, license, sell, stream, 
transmit, synchronize (as applicable, only with visual images embodied 
within videos on YouTube), perform, promote, and otherwise exploit 
such Catalog and any and all rights in and to the sound recording(s) and 
the underlying composition(s) in such Catalog, throughout the world, in 
any and all media or formats now known or  hereafter devised, including 
without limitation by:
- permanent digital downloads;
- temporary digital downloads;
- interactive streaming;
- non-interactive streaming;
- interactive radio; and
- non-interactive radio (DMCA compliant, compulsory license);
- Semi-interactive radio (voluntary license);
- The servicing of any and all "existing" and "to be" developed 
digital and mobile delivery methods.
You authorize Best So Far to sub-license any rights granted by you 
under this Distribution Agreement to any Third Party Music Services, as 
required to provide the Service hereunder. The authorization and grant 
of rights hereundershall be exclusive as to the Third Party Music Services, 
authorized. Best So Far does not guarantee placement of the Catalog 
with any Third Party Music Services and reserves the right to remove 
any content from the Service and reject distribution of any content in 
its discretion in the event that your song is rejected due to any issues 
involving your release, and until such a  time that any such issues are 
resolved.<br> <br><br>


                5. Your Obligations to Others <br> 
                In connection with exploitation of the Catalog contemplated hereunder, 
you shall be solely responsible for (a) all record royalties due to artists, 
producers and other persons who performed in the making of the Music 
and other royalty participants, (b) all royalties due to any party as a 
result of samples included in the Music (c) all payments that may be 
required under collective bargaining agreements applicable to you and 
your affiliates, and (d) all music publishing licenses and royalties.
For digital download sales in the United States, your payment typically 
includes the mechanical royalty on the underlying composition. In the 
case of the iTunes Match service, your payment includes a publishing 
portion that covers both the mechanical and public performance 
royalties. If you do not own or control the underlying composition(s) in 
your sound recording(s), it is your obligation to pay these publishing 
royalties to the person or entity that does. Outside of the United States, 
Best So Far customarily requires Third Party Music Services to secure 
and pay for music publishing licenses (and such license fees may or may 
not be deducted by the Third Party Music Services concerned from the 
proceeds payable to Best So Far). If any Third Party Music Service 
outside of the United States does not agree to secure and pay for music 
publishing licenses, Best So Far  shall have the right, in its sole discretion, 
to either (i) decline to license such Third Party Music Service or (b) 
assume the responsibility to clear and pay for the music publishing 
licenses required in connection with such Third Party Music Service's 
sales, which license fees Amuse shall have the right to deduct from 
amounts payable to you hereunder.
          <br/><br/><br> 
                6. Revenue / Payment <br> 
                Best So Far will pay Content Distributor one-hundred percent (100%) 
of any Net Royalties received from the authorized Third Party Music 
Services, unless another agreement has made between you and Best So 
Far . "Net Royalties" as used herein means BSF's actual receipts from 
the Third Party Music Services for the sale, distribution or other use of 
your Catalog, less any (a) tax, bank transfer and PayPal or other 
payment services transaction fees (if any); (b) marketplace costs, 
including without limitation any fees, payments, royalties or other 
consideration payable by Best So Far to Third Party Music Services and 
digital retail stores; and (c) licensing fees and royalties payable to song 
publishing licensors and compulsory mechanical licensors, as applicable.
Content Distributor shall be solely responsible for tracking and paying 
any taxes and governmental fees associated with or incurred in 
exploitation of the Catalog through the Service, including without 
limitation any tariffs, value-added taxes or governmental fees.
Accounting statements and your Net Royalties will be electronically 
posted to you in a timely fashion after BSFs receipt thereof. Once 
payment has been credited to your Best So Far  user account, you will be 
able to receive the outstanding amount at your discretion. Your balance 
must exceed a minimum of $10, Calculated at the current exchange 
rate at the time of transaction,  to withdraw money from your account. 
You will be solely responsible for any bank transfer and the party 
transaction fees or other charges related to such withdrawals.
Unless other payment arrangements are made between you and Best So 
Far,  Best So Far  shall remit payment to you according to  the  agreement 
and any account preference, at BSF's sole discretion.
Content Distributor shall have the right to appoint a certified public 
accountant who has signed confidentiality agreement with respect to 
BSF's books, to audit    Best So Far's books and records to verify the 
accuracy of such statements, once with respect to any statement, once 
in each year, at Content Distributor's expense, at the place where Best 
So Far maintains such records, during BSF's normal business hours and 
on at least sixty (60) days' prior notice. All objections concerning 
payments hereunder shall be submitted by Content Distributor within 
one (1) year after the date of payment, after which time all objections 
shall be waived. 
<br/><br/><br> 
                7. Processing Your Content<br> 
                Subsequent to your acceptance of this Distribution Agreement, and your 
delivery of the digital files of the Music with accurate metadata and 
cover artwork that fulfil the requirements set forth on the distribution 
platform, Best So Far may deliver the Music and applicable Digital 
Assets to the selected Third Party Music Services.
You may indefinitely withhold any of the Music from any store(s) of 
your choosing by selecting the appropriate option in writing on
submission of your release. You may also, after withholding Music from a 
particular store, email customersupport@bestsofar.co.za to request 
delivery of the Music to such store, at BSF's discretion.<br> <br><br> 
          

                8. Warranty & Disclaimer<br> 
                Each party warrants and represents to the other party that it has the 
right and authority to enter into and perform this Distribution 
Agreement, and that it will comply with all applicable laws in the 
performance of this Distribution Agreement.
Additionally, you hereby warrant and represent that you own, control

Catalog in all manner hereunder free from adverse claim and without 
any obligation to make any payment of any nature to any person or 
entity, other than the amounts due to you described under this 
Distribution Agreement.
You hereby agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Best So Far harmless 
from any and all costs, losses, damages, or expenses arising out of any 
breach of the foregoing warranties and representations. You also hereby 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Best So Far and those authorized 
by Best So Far to use and/or exploit the Catalog harmless from and 
against any and all claims, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses, 
including reasonable counsel fees and litigation expenses, arising out of 
the use of the Catalog as contemplated hereunder. If a claim is made, 
Best So Far reserves the right to withhold payment of royalties 
hereunder in an amount reasonably related to the claim and potential 
expenses.
If you are acting for the benefit of, and/or as an agent or representative 
of any artist, individual, group, or corporation, you and the parties that 
you represent shall be bound to the terms of this Distribution 
Agreement and shall be jointly and severally liable for your breach of the 
Distribution Agreement and for breach of the Distribution Agreement 
by any of the parties you represent.
BSF DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH 
HEREIN, AND DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN 
ADDITION, BSF MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AS 
TO THE FUNCTIONALITY, PERFORMANCE, OR RESULTS OF BSF'S 
WEBSITE OR SERVICE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL BSF, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, 
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, 
SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND.
Nothing in this Distribution Agreement removes or limits either party's 
liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal 
injury caused by its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross 
negligence.
<br/><br/><br> 
                9. Covenant Not to Sue<br> 
                In consideration of Best So Far's entering into this Distribution 
Agreement, you covenant and agree, in respect to the Catalog not to 
bring, assert, pursue, maintain, join in or directly and/or indirectly 
support, assist, fund, lend resources to, or otherwise participate in any 
litigation, involving or asserting any claim based upon or alleging any 
form of copyright infringement arising from BSF's or any Third Party

that you may have elected to link to your account. Please review our fully transparent Privacy Policy for information 
regarding security, confidentiality, and what we do with the data you

submit the Recordings, cover artwork and any other information and 
material at your own expense and in formats required for use on the

                6. Royalties and Payouts <br> 
                You keep 100% of your royalties earned,unless otherwise stipulated and 
agreed upon by you and Best So Far, with the exception of any 
applicable taxes due from you by law and any payment, currency 
exchange and banking fees charged by the payout method. You are to 
every extent responsible for paying any other rights holders that you 
might (producer, featured artist etc.) have and any applicable taxes 
according to the tax laws of your country.
You agree that your royalties are subject to the conditions and pro rata 
provisions as agreed in each agreement Best So Far has entered into 
with the Stores. The price is determined by us and the Stores, in our sole 
discretion.
The Stores report your earned royalties to us. Royalties will be credited 
to your Best So Far Account monthly. The royalties refer to previous 
months as reported to us by the Stores, after we've received payment 
from the Stores. Each Store has their own timeline delay of reporting 
your earned royalties, usually between 2-3 months. When royalties have 
been credited to your account, you are able to receive the money. Do 
note that due to the reporting delay, you will not receive any royalties 
during your first month(s) until Best So Far has received the first 
reports from the Stores.
The minimum amount you can pay out is 10 USD and cannot be paid 
out in parts. The payout process takes about 3-5 business days. We will 
do our best to comply with this.
Payout methods include Pay Pal, Square, Pay Fast, and Stripe. You 
must hold one of the above accounts ("Payment Account") to be able to 
receive your royalties earned. Best So Far reserves the right to add and 
change method of payout. If your Payment account information has 
changed, it is your responsibility to inform Best So Far about the 
changes. We reserve the right to withhold a payout should we suspect 
that the Payout  information is incorrect or that an unauthorised person 
has accessed your account. Should a Store report the wrong amount, however great, of royalties 
that you have earned, Best So Far reserves the right to retroactively 
amend this. 
<br> <br>

of distributing your Recordings. You may choose the Stores you want

Service providers and others
We may from time to time share your information with service 
providers to perform functions and process user data and help provide 
our Service, consistent with this Privacy Policy. Where a third party 
processes user data on our behalf (e.g., a hosting service provider), it is 
subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this 
Privacy Policy and applicable law. Where a third party processes user 
data on its own behalf, its processing is subject to its own Privacy Policy 
and applicable law.
In addition to the above, we may also share your information with third 
parties for these limited purposes:

<br> <br><br> 
                5. Transfer to Other Countries<br> 
                If you're a resident  of South Africa  or the  SADC Region, you understand 
that your information may be transferred to and stored outside of that 
area. The country it is transferred to might not have the same 
protection laws as your country. However, if we do transfer your 
information, we will make sure that we protect your person al data in 
accordance with the GDPR requirements and set up contracts with 
those parties to ensure this. 
<br> <br><br> 
                6. Children<br> 
                We do not let children under the age of 18 to register with our Services 
and therefore, we do not knowingly collect personal information from 
children. If you are a guardian of a child under the age of 18 and 
become aware that your child has provided personal information to us, 
please contact us via email and you may request to access and/or cancel 
the Service. If you are a resident under the age of 18 and you wish to 
remove publicly available content, also please contact via email.<br> <br><br> 

                7. How We Protect Your information<br> 
                Your security is important to us. We always do our best to maintain 
administrative, technical and physical safeguards to help protect your 
personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, 
alteration or disclosure.
Since the Internet can't be 100% secure, make sure you protect your 
password and username to prevent anyone from accessing your 
information.
<br> <br><br> 
                8. Your Rights, How to Contact Us and 
Complaints<br> 
                You are always entitled to receive information on data we have on you, 
free of charge. You also have the right to request to be erased and to get 
any inaccurate personal data blocked or corrected. Where we rely on 
consent to process your data, you can withdraw this consent at any 
time. Contact us!
To send a request, please contact us 
at customersupport@bestsofar.co.za with your name, address, 
username and the email address you used when you registered with us.
If you're not happy with how we handle your information, please 
contact us.  
If you have a complaint in relation to the processing of your data, you 
have the right to lodge a complaint to the supervisory data authority. <br> <br><br> 

                9. Changes to the Privacy Policy<br> 
                We may make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we changes, we'll notify 
you by either displaying a notice within the Service or by sending you an 
email. If the change is minor, we'll just make the changes here. Please 
make sure you read the notices carefully. If  you do not want to continue 
using our Service under the new version of the Privacy Policy, please 
terminate your account.<br> <br><br> 
              
                10. Cookies<br> 
                We and others working on our behalf employ cookies and related 
technologies to store information on or read information from your 
browser or device. They help us improve your experience, our Service 
and our marketing activities.
Your web browser is probably set to accept cookies by default. You can 
choose to change this to remove and reject cookies. If you do, this might 
affect certain features on our Service and some things might not work. 
If you use our Service on a mobile device, you can limit tracking and 
targeting in relation to ads. We cannot, however, control these opt out 
processes. You can also check www.aboutcookies.org to find out more on 
how you change your browser settings.
Sometimes we use pixel tags. The pixel tags are placed on certain web 
pages and when you access those web pages, the pixel tag generates a 
generic notice of the visit and permits us to see or read our cookies. 
They are used together with cookies to track activity on a site by a 
particular device. If you turn off cookies, we can only see anonymous 
website visits.
We may use the following types of cookies: 
1.  Strictly necessary cookies. These cookies are required for the operation of our 
site.
2.  Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the 
number of visitors and see how visitors move around our Services. This helps us 
improve our Service.
3.  Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. Sometimes we use or partner with app 
developer platforms that use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as 
mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and information 
connected to how mobile devices interact with our Service and those using our 
Service.
